# In the 90s, Microsoft used a very simple algorithm for determining validity
# of software keys. This applies to Windows 95, Office 95, and NT4, as well as
# other software products, such as Encarta.
#
# There are two major types of keys, 10-digit keys and OEM keys.
#
# 10-digit keys take the format of XXX-XXXXXXX.
# The first 3 digits can be any value except repeating digits of 3-9.
# The second 7 digits have the following restrictions
#  - The sum of the digits must be evenly divisible by 7
#  - The last digit cannot be 0 or >= 8
#
# OEM keys are a little more complicated.
# They take the form of XXXXX-OEM-XXXXXXX-XXXXX
# The first segment is actually a date. The first 3 digits are a julian or
#   ordinal date, and are a number between 1 and 366. The second 2 digits are a
#   year, between 95 and 03.
# The second segment must always be the letters OEM
# The third segment is the same as the above 10-digit keys, with one exception:
#   The first digit must be 0.
# The fourth segment can be anything, provided its appropriate length
#
#
# Task
# - Write a function that will check a given CD key thats valid. Your function
#   should support both 10-digit and OEM keycodes
# â€“ Write a function that will generate valid keycodes, letting the user choose
#   between OEM and 10-digit keycodes. Make an attempt to have the function
#   generate as random a value as possible.
#
# Make every attempt to make your program "ruby-ish".
